# Westlaw Annoyance Fixer
Thompson Reuter's Westlaw is a great resource with an annoying problem. After a while of inactivity, or if network connectivity changes, Westlaw will automatically sign you out. When this happens, all open Westlaw pages are replaced with a sign-on page, with the option to log back in and return to the previous page. Because Bowdoin uses a campus subscription to Westlaw, individual students don't have their own accounts, so it is impossible to return to the page. This is a severe annoyance; a huge amount of research can be lost when ~20 tabs of open cases revert to the sign on page.

### Enter the **Westlaw Annoyance Fixer** chrome extension.
With two buttons, one can now log back in without navigating to Bowdoin's library page to find the link, and also "refresh" sign out pages back to the original page.

### Planned additions for this extension:
- Support other campus-wide subscriptions rather than just Bowdoin's
- "Refresh" all open Westlaw sign-on tabs after signing back in
- Do the preceding automatically when the unintential sign-out occurs
